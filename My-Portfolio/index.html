 CA FEEDBACK

Great start to your portfolio, let’s add more content to it to better optimize it. We want it to meet Industry standards and become a competitive candidate.

 

Here are some things to keep in mind as you continue to develop your portfolio and meet Industry standards.

 

Resume 

It’s great that you already have a contact section! In your contact section, include a link to your LinkedIn profile. Additionally, please include a link to an updated resume. 





Project 

To ensure you have an Industry-backed portfolio, it is important to include links to both the GitHub repository as well as the live application for each of your listed projects (for projects without a front-end or Node work that you are displaying, I recommend linking to another page where you can showcase GIFs and screenshots of your project working). This is how you will demonstrate your skill set to an employer and show the results of your technical skills.  



Here are some things to keep in mind as you continue to develop your portfolio become an Employer-Competitive candidate.



Bio

Your bio is coming along great, but I would also encourage you to add a few sentences where you really describe your passion for entering into this field. Here, you can give recruiters an insight into what motivates you professionally, and what you aim to achieve/accomplish in each project. What is your end goal? Why do you want to achieve what you want to achieve? Including this information provides substance so employers can identify what will motivate you to succeed within their organization. I also recommend that you touch upon your technical ‘hard’ skills in your “About me”. Choose your top skills. I recommend going above and beyond just writing a list -  you can visualize them using icons or organizing them into sections.  Providing a list of strengths adds to your ‘marketability’ by demonstrating the skills you bring to the table as a candidate.  



Note: I do not recommend listing your skill level. Skill levels are arbitrary.  “50% of HTML” doesn’t really offer any useful information because there’s no frame of reference established. This can only hurt you - by giving the reader a false impression of your abilities before you are given a chance to show them yourself. 



Project

As a web developer, projects are going to be your most effective currency while job searching. The feedback we have received from employers is that a great portfolio stands out because it takes the opportunity to explain the ‘why’ and ‘how’ behind your projects. Set aside space in your portfolio for project descriptions. Your project descriptions should include:  

The problem that your application solves. Does your app tell the weather? Does it make it easier to get dressed in the morning? Is it a  dating app for poodles?  
The technologies you used to build it. Showcase the technical side of each project by including the technical skills and core concepts required to build the project
Your role on the project. Was this a group project? An individual project? Did you primarily work on the front end? Were your responsibilities full-stack?  


Additionally, building a great front-end is important for a beginner developer’s portfolio to stand out. As a final (additional) step, I would encourage you to really make your front-end your own. Whether you transform this all together or add some interactive elements, we want to show your reader your design and front-end abilities. There is no shame in using a template for your portfolio - most beginning web developers do! 



Here are some Bootstrap templates for your portfolio.
